A fantasy dungeon crawl

Zed Shaw in his book Learn Python the Hard Way bulids a game he calls, "Gothons from Planet Percal #25." In lesson 43, his instructions are to take this game and make it your own. He builds a rough skeleton of the game and then tells you to code the rest without looking at any of the code in the solution. 

And that is what I am doing with this game. 

I am going to take this game, put it into a fantasy setting and make up my own things, using the basic class hierarchy Zed gives me. It's simple. It's linear. But it is not meant to be anything more than that. I don't have a good basis in object oriented programming, and I am going to use this game to build those skills a bit. Starting on October 10th, I want to see how long it takes me to come up with a game I am satisfied with.

Let's see how it goes.
